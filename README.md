## CashScript

CashScript is a high-level language that allows you to write Bitcoin Cash smart contracts in a straightforward and familiar way. Its syntax is inspired by Ethereum's Solidity language, but its functionality is different since the underlying systems have very different fundamentals. See the [language documentation](https://cashscript.org/docs/language/) for a full reference of the language.

## Acknowledgements

The original version of this extension was created by [Nathaniel Cherian](https://github.com/nathanielCherian) and was inspired by [vscode-solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity).
